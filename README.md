**EDA on HR Analytics**  
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IBM HR Analytics dataset to gain insights into employee attrition and performance. The dataset contains various features related to employees, such as their job role, education level, years of experience, and job satisfaction, among others.
The EDA process involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting descriptive statistical analysis, visualizing the data using plots and charts, and performing correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between variables.
Additionally, the project explores the factors that contribute to employee attrition and examines the impact of different features on employee performance. The findings from this EDA project provide valuable insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and performance. These insights can assist organizations in making informed decisions related to talent retention and management strategies. By understanding the key drivers of employee attrition and performance, companies can take proactive measures to improve employee satisfaction, reduce turnover rates, and enhance overall organizational performance.

**Objective**  
The objective of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance dataset to identify factors contributing to employee attrition and understand the impact of different features on employee performance. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to gain insights into the relationships between variables and provide recommendations for talent retention and management strategies.

**Description of dataset**  
The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of employee-related information. It includes both numerical and categorical variables, providing a holistic view of the workforce within the fictional organization. The dataset contains features such as age, gender, education, job role, job satisfaction, performance rating, and attrition status. By exploring this dataset, we can gain insights into the relationships between different variables and their impact on attrition and performance. For example, we can examine whether certain demographics or job characteristics play a significant role in employee attrition rates. Additionally, we can investigate how job satisfaction and performance ratings relate to attrition and identify potential predictors of high or low performance.
